But that‚Äôs not true the opening track with the finger snaps is literally copy paste of an actual old-school rap song. I‚Äôve found it once I just can‚Äôt find it again.

In the mini docu-series she released on YouTube after self-titled was released she said the beat was originally just the snaps and and drums inspired by old Houston rappers.','-','/r/beyonce/comments/lh6de3/apart_from_the_big_lebowski_audio_in_partition/gn18723/'

'gm16o3p','2021-02-04 21:37:19','GreenDolphin86','lcdmia','Formation','Water is a huge symbol all over Lemonade. Specifically on Formation she uses Katrina as a way to highlight Black trauma and the ways it has been ignored. But also to highlight the resiliency of the Black community. Katrina might have bent New Orleans but it did not break them. Likewise infidelity might have bent her relationship but it did not break it. Likewise being Black in America racism has always tried to bend us but we will not break. The last scene is particularly powerful as you see the role reversal I talked about earlier. Now instead of the flood waters drowning Black bodies it is the weight of Blackness our power our resilience that causes the unjust systems to drown.  I‚Äôm very interested in Black history Black art and Beyonce so having them all rolled into one was a real treat for me! As you can tell I‚Äôve given the whole project a great deal of thought and have read and listened to a lot of things other folks have said about it too. It‚Äôs an artistic achievement! I think the biggest affect has been conversations! Conversations about Blackness Black Womanhood generational trauma and a host of other things that we typically shy away from because they aren‚Äôt always easy conversations.','gm12zr0','/r/beyonce/comments/lcdmia/formation/gm16o3p/'

'gm0sj7j','2021-02-04 20:02:24','NAV_Randi','lcdmia','Formation','The Formation video is such a powerful music video! Shes addressing police brutality Black lives matters hurricane Katrina (specifically how the US government were critizised for not responding and doing enough for the citizens of NO) and women empowerment. In the specific scene you are asking about (and this is just my opinion and analyze of the scene) I think the kid is break-dancing to show how black culture is widely popular but still black people are victims of oppression and racism daily. Normally a black person would be the one holding his/her hands up in front of police officers but this time the police officers are holding their hands up. They are seen as a threat to the little boy instead of the other way around. Remember Trayvon Martin was shot because they thought he looked threathening in his black hoodie. And as you can see the kid in the music video is also wearing a black hoodie. The scene is brilliant if you ask me and shows just how detailed Queen Bey is in her art.','-','/r/beyonce/comments/lcdmia/formation/gm0sj7j/'
'gm0scqb','2021-02-04 20:01:13','GreenDolphin86','lcdmia','Formation','Yes feel free to reference.      My response is that something can be two things. When political speakers go to places for lectures talks etc you better believe they collect a fee too because labor is not free  or cheap and everybody has to eat.   But to claim that the message she is trying to send is disengeniouos because she also made money from it seems silly. She is also Black and no amount of money removes her from racial truama so why wouldnt she make art that responds to it?','gm0rf41','/r/beyonce/comments/lcdmia/formation/gm0scqb/'

'gm0nbfa','2021-02-04 19:28:37','GreenDolphin86','lcdmia','Formation','Formation is a call to action. It comes at the end of the project after Beyonce has realized her own power in taking control of the narrative so that she can heal and grow from it. On Formation she is encouraging others to do the same. Recognize your own power get in Formation and slay.   You would need to be more specific about other scenes that I could clarify but the scene you name is again about recognizing our own power as Black people. The current power narrative dictates that police have the power of Black people. Beyonc√© flips that narrative on its head by showing that Black people also have power. The power that makes people love our art our dances our music our soul. In this version of the power narrative you have the police surrendering to the power of that little boy and his dancing.','-','/r/beyonce/comments/lcdmia/formation/gm0nbfa/'

When Beyonc√©‚Äôs name is attached or involved in something people expect a high quality product and she will work to deliver a product that meets her high standards of excellence (and often surpass other‚Äôs expectations). Her brand power brings in wealth for other brands that use her image and her exclusivity also adds to that influencing the general public to overall expect good things and view that particular brand/event/project etc as worth investing their time and money into.','-','/r/beyonce/comments/l6fbbj/this_is_for_a_research_project_hehe/gl0dabe/'

Then listen to all her collabs from Mi Gente Perfect Top Off Shining Lift Off Bonnie & Clyde Family Feud Telephone Until the End of Time Hymn for the Weekend Walk on Water Runnin Feelin Myself Savage Love in this Club Back to Black.  Then I would go back and listen to the live albums Beyonc√© Live at Wembley (if you can find it online) The Beyonc√© Experience I Am World Tour I Am Yours...An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas (the vocals are insane) and Live at Roseland.   Then after that listen to the soundtracks from all her movies they are a treat! Goldmember sound track is great The Fighting Temptations Carmen A Hip Hopera DreamGirls Cadillac Records and listen to Rise Up from Epic the soundtrack.  Then I would listen to her unreleased album Speak My Mind and all her unreleased songs on YouTube. There are so many unreleased great tracks from I Can‚Äôt Take no More to Wishing on a Star Back up Lost Yo Mind and Creole!

'giliios','2021-01-09 00:28:08','GreenDolphin86','kt4ngq','what are some of your unpopular opinions?','Jay‚Äôs grandma.   But the album does both things equally and that is the complexity of the album.   The point is that systemic racism is a part of the reason for the infidelity. Broken man/woman relationships between Black people have existed  since they tore families apart at the auction. The notion that Black men are not family men is also rooted in racism. And the list can go on.   You are spot on about Hatties words being the thesis of the album but the experience of taking lemons and making lemonade is also applicable to the Black experience. We took the lemons that the Black experience has brought us and turned them into the Lemonade that is jazz r&b the Harlem Renaissance hip hop music and of course most specifically this very album.','gilhbgi','/r/beyonce/comments/kt4ngq/what_are_some_of_your_unpopular_opinions/giliios/'
'gilhbgi','2021-01-09 00:18:14','weigh2phat','kt4ngq','what are some of your unpopular opinions?','I love that comparison about Harriet Tubman and I understand your point. I guess it boils down to one‚Äôs perspective of the album and which of it‚Äôs two narratives the mending of a marriage or the overcoming of systematic racism is more prominent. In my opinion the album focuses more on the former and All night is the conclusive anthem that signifies the end of that story. In addition Bey includes her grandmother‚Äôs(correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) words about overcoming a situation and making ‚Äúlemonade.‚Äù It serves as the thesis of the album Hattie‚Äôs words and to me it makes sense to have it and the subsequent song that goes with it All night at the end.','gil7fng','/r/beyonce/comments/kt4ngq/what_are_some_of_your_unpopular_opinions/gilhbgi/'
