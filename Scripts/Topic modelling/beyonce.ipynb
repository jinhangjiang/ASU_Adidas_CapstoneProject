I request you all to boycott this video and boycott these mainstream Bollywood blockbusters which contain hurtful comments and racist slurs.\n",
      "Comment Body: I saw this video today and got through about 40 seconds of it, it is so cringe. And that actress is beyond basic and cannot dance. What bothers me is that no one truly apologized for this. It‚Äôs like when kareena made racist comments to Bipasha and people passed it off as her being a sassy diva. I hate Bollywood more than Hollywood. At least Hollywood has evolved, Bollywood has gotten worse. Now you literally see white women being casted in roles written for an Indian character.\n",
